How does a function which produces a quantum state process a "classical" state?
By contrast, how does it process another quantum state?
QState = [state1, state2, state3]
f(state) = states
==> f(states) = [f(state) | state <- states]
ensemble of quantum states: "nested" monad
Superposition :: Monad
- How to guarantee that amplitudes sum to 1 programmatically?
  - "N-Branching" of lists of numbers
  {x, y, z} -> {x/2, x/2, y, z}
- Matrix exponentials
- Desired behavior:
  Given a measurement setup and an initial state, calculate or approximate some
  relevant quantity.
- Measurement apparatus has well-defined behavior on classical states
- Reversible vs. probabilistic measurements
- qstate >>= measurement
- Hermitian conjugate (adjoint)
- class Hilbert (?)
  - derives from Monoid:
    - mzero = vacuum
    - mplus = superpose
    - fmap = lift
    - bind = action on basis vectors
    - Implements additional structure: inner product
      - Functor?

* Question: Given a "free" context constructor, how do we represent its operation on
  contextual objects?
- Context constructors in physics:
  - Ensemble
    --> Meta-ensembles?
  - State
  - Coordinates
  - Tensors?
    --> Bind == covariant derivative?
    ...or Bind == "tensor of tensor"
  - Differential forms
    --> Bind == exterior derivative from del
  - Operator
    --> Bind == commutator; composition
  - Category: Operators on H
    - Left / right identities: trivial
    - Not associative:
      [A, [B, C]] + [B, [C, A]] + [C, [A, B]] = 0
  - Map x -> operator: quantum field
    - Composition of fields: tensor product of Fock spaces

-- Ten commandments of grad school:
-- When you're at work:
-- 1. Don't play chess.
-- 2. Don't sleep.
-- 3. Don't do work in common spaces.
-- 4. Reply to emails right away.
-- 5. Don't read blogs or have non-math / physics tabs open.
-- 6. Don't read Quora.
-- 7. Make a point of talking to and interacting with people--start conversations about physics.
-- 8. Collaborate on work.
-- 9. Dress nicely.
-- 10. Don't talk about outside life with colleagues.
